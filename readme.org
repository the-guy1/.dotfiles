[[./.config/screenshot.png]]
I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]] to create symlinks with the actual config files.

These are here mainly so if I need to reinstall my operating system or my entire computer. I do not really believe that anyone other than me would actually use these.

* These are my files
- Xresources
- zsh
- xmonad & xmobar
    I don't use xmonad but I might want to at some time
- paru
    My AUR helper
- i3
    This is my actual Window manager
- alacritty
- awesome bspwm and qtile

- dunst
- neofetch
- neovim
  I mainly use emacs but I still like to maintain and occasionally use neovim. Mainly when I am already in the terminal so I can still remember all of the shortcuts because vi/vim/neovim is on most linux computers as well as OSX and sooner or latter you might need to use it.
- ranger
  my terminal based file manager
- sxhkd
  keyboard shortcuts for bspwm
- reddhift
  for adjusting bluelight during the evenings
- betterlockscreen
  This is my lock screen its relatively small while showing more information than most tiny lockscreens
