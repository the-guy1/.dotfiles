[[./.config/screenshot.png]]
I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]] to create symlinks with the actual config files.

These are here mainly so if I need to reinstall my operating system or my entire computer. I do not really believe that anyone other than me would actually use these.

** neovim
I mainly use emacs but I still like to maintain and occasionally use neovim. Mainly when I am already in the terminal so I can still remember all of the shortcuts because vi/vim/neovim is on most linux computers as well as OSX and sooner or latter you might need to use it.
** ranger
This is an older but still well maintained and well enjoyed terminal file manager
** reddhift
 for adjusting bluelight during the evenings
** betterlockscreen
