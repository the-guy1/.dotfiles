* About config
This is a Window manager that is completely controlled by shell commands which means that it is very basic but customizeable

* Screen Shots

* Config

** Setup
This is for setting up the shell script used for bspwm. This says that the script is written in shell script
#+begin_src sh
#! /bin/sh

#+end_src

** Monitor and workspaces
This is where I tell bspwm what monitor gets which workspaces but since this is a laptop I only use one monitor they only go on the one
#+begin_src sh
bspc monitor -d I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X

#+end_src

** SXHKD
This is important because it is used for keyboard shortcuts because bspwm doesn't have its our keyboard shortcut program and so you cannot open anything withoutit.
#+begin_src sh
pgrep -x sxhkd > /dev/null ||sxhkd &

#+end_src

** bspwm rules
These are some of the rules that bspwm needs to have to run properly
#+begin_src sh
bspc config border_width         2
bspc config window_gap          1

bspc config split_ratio          0.52
bspc config borderless_monocle   true
bspc config gapless_monocle      true

bspc rule -a Chromium desktop='^2'

#+end_src

These are the color that bspwm uses
#+begin_src sh
